# python-api-challenge
## This activity is broken down into two deliverables, *WeatherPy* and *VacationPy*. 

1. WeatherPy: Create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 

2. VacationPy:  Use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
